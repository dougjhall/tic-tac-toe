# :x: Tic Tac Toe :o:

This Python program is a simple tic tac toe game.

It is a two player game, where each player takes turns choosing which position on the board they would like to play their turn until there is a winner or a draw.

It has basic input verification built in that will prevent the player from submitting dis-allowed text.

It is very much a MVP version of the game. 

Hope you enjoy!
